<div>This set of controls enables the robot to be selected, 
    its speed to be set, and excursions to be performed.
    <h4>Select Robot</h4>
    <p>This dropdown enables a robot to be selected.</p>
    <h4>Set Speeds</h4>
    <p>This dropdown allows the rotational and driving speeds to be set.</p>
    <h4>Route</h4>
    <p>This button will initiate a manouvre around the entire route.<br/> 
        If a previous excursion did not complete, then a prompt will appear with options to continue or restart.</p>
    <h4>Skip</h4>
    <p>This button will skip a node in the route and send the robot to the next destination.</p>

    <p>This button will initiate a driving operation to any location set manually.</p>
    <h4>Cancel</h4>
    <p>This button will cancel the current excursion.</p>
    <h4>Pause</h4>

    <h4>Step</h4>
    <p>This button becomes active when the excursion is paused. 
        It steps the motion on to the next step, allowing detailed debugging of the strategy.</p>
    <h4>Reset</h4>
    <div>The reset button performs a number of tasks:
        <ul>
            <li>Cancels driving</li>
            <li>Resets the position of any virtual mower</li>
            <li>Clears down the quality statistics</li>
            <li>Clears the snapshot buffer</li>
            <li>Resets the Viewport</li>
        </ul>
        If the vision system is having difficulty locating the real robot, it may be latched onto a noise contour, 
        and a reset may resolve the situation.

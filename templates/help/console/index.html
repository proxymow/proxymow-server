<h2 id="console">Robot Console Feature</h2>
<p>The <em>Robot Console</em> is a simple form enabling commands to be sent to the robot.</p>
<p>The feature comprises:
<ul>
    <li>An input box where commands can be typed</li>
    <li>A dropdown list of common commands</li>
    <li>A submit button</li>
    <li>A pane to display the command response</li>
</ul>
The Robot Console offers a richer interface compared to the Supervisor's Direct Commands.
Any command supported by the robot can be sent, both synchronous and asynchronous.
Commands can be repeated more easily, and the response can be verified.

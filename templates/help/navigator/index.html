<h2 id="navigator">Navigator</h2>
    <p>The <em>Navigator</em> is a feature for managing the navigation strategy.</p>
	<p>The feature comprises:
		<ul>
		    <li>A header toolbar</li>
		    <li>The <em>top-down</em> Arena View</li>
		    <li>A monitor pane showing current system state</li>
		    <li>A toolbar with tools to manage excursions</li>
		    <li>A table of <em>Terms</em> for the current navigation strategy</li>
		    <li>A table of <em>Rules</em> for the current navigation strategy</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
    <h3>The Header Toolbar</h3>
        <p>This toolbar hosts Profile, Navigation Strategy and Mowing Pattern dropdowns plus a freeze button, 
            enabling page refreshes to be frozen.<br/><br/>
            Navigation pages are expensive to process, and the resource drain has a detrimental impact on frame rate. 
            Use the freeze button to pause page refreshes when they are not required, or close the tab. In any case auto-freeze 
            will kick in after a pre-defined interval. </p>
    <h3>The Arena View</h3>
		<p>The arena view is a helicopter view of the lawn, with the route overlaid.
		A marker can be dropped onto this view with a double mouse click, setting the target destination.
		The terms and rules will then refresh to reflect this target destination, 
		but no commands will be issued until the Drive button is clicked. 
		</p>
    <h3>The Monitor Pane</h3>
        <p>This includes:</p>
        {% include "help/monitor.html" %}
    <h3>Control Toolbar</h3>
        {% include "help/common_controls.html" %}
    <h3>Terms Table</h3>
        <div>This table displays the terms that are available to be used in navigation strategy rules.<br/><br/>
            Each term has the following properties:
		    <ul>
		        <li>Name - identifier used in rule formulae</li>
		        <li>Description - a description of the term</li>
		        <li>Expression - formula or constant</li>
		        <li>Result - evaluation of expression</li>
		        <li>Units - metres, radians, etc.</li>
		        <li>Alt Expression - an alternative way to express the term</li>
		        <li>Alt Result - the alternative result</li>
		        <li>Alt Units - metres, radians, etc.</li>
		        <li>Colour - used for graphical annotation</li>
		    </ul>
            <p>There are 3 types of terms:</p>
		    <ul>
		        <li>User terms</li>
		        <li>Hybrid Terms</li>
		        <li>System Terms</li>
		    </ul>
    <h4>User Terms</h4>
	    <p>
	        User terms are created, edited and deleted by the user. They are typically used for constants like home radius, home sector, etc.<br/><br/>
	        User terms are also a convenient way to graphically annotate the Arena View. A colour can be specified, which is interpreted in the following way:
	        <ul>
	            <li>Single value - displayed as text: name = value</li>
	            <li>Pair of x,y values - drawn as a point at (x, y)</li>
	            <li>Trio of values x, y, r - drawn as a circle of radius r and centred on (x, y)</li>
	            <li>Quartet of values x1, y1, x2, y2 - drawn as a dashed line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2)</li>
	        </ul>
	        <p>The system will aggregate different terms sharing the same colour, or additional graphical terms can be created that group existing terms.</p>
	    </p>
    <h4>Hybrid Terms</h4>
	    <p>Hybrid terms are provided by the system, so can't be deleted, but can be edited. 
	    For example, Proxymow Server has an implementation of the Pure Pursuit algorithm built-in, 
	    and hence available to be used in user-defined strategies. Pure Pursuit expects a Look-Ahead distance to be defined, 
	    so this is implemented as a Hybrid Term.</p>
    <h4>System Terms</h4>
	    <p>System terms are terms which can't be edited or deleted. There is a rich tapestry of system terms which can be used in navigation strategies.</p>
	    </p>
    User and Hybrid terms can be edited by double-clicking the relevant row to pop-up a form.
</div>
<h3>Rules Table</h3>
<p>This table displays the user-defined rules that control the motion of the robot. 
Rules can be edited by double-clicking the relevant row to pop-up a form.<br/><br/>
    Each rule has the following properties:
    <ul>
        <li>Name - name of the rule</li>
        <li>Description - a description of the rule</li>
        <li>Priority - order in which rules are processed</li>
        <li>Condition - expression for rule selection</li>
        <li>Left Speed Expression</li>
        <li>Left Speed Result</li>
        <li>Right Speed Expression</li>
        <li>Right Speed Result</li>
        <li>Duration/Cmd Expression</li>
        <li>Duration/Cmd Result</li>
        <li>Stage Complete</li>
        <li>Scope</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Rules are selected based on the condition expression evaluating to True.
    The currently selected rule is highlighted in the table.
    There are 2 types of rule that can be used: Sweep rules and Auxillary rules.
    </p>
    <h4>Sweep Rules</h4>
    <p>
    Most rules will be Sweep rules, where the Left Speed[%], Right Speed[%] and Duration[ms] expressions 
    generate the vlaues for a robot command.<pre>sweep(left, right, duration)</pre>  
    <h4>Stage Termination</h4>
    <p>A rule may have the <em>Stage Terminator</em> flag set. When such a rule is selected, 
    it signals to the rules engine that the currect stage is complete and we can start navigating to the next.</p>
    </p>
    <h4>Rule Scope</h4>
    <p>
    The scope of a rule can be set to one of:
	    <ul>
	        <li>Stationary</li>
	        <li>In-flight</li>
	        <li>Any</li>
	        <li>Disabled</li>
	    </ul> 
    </p>
    <h5>Sationary Scope</h4>
	    <p>Rules in stationary scope will only qualify for selection if the robot is at rest. 
	    This is the safest setting, avoiding any issues with lag in communications or the vision system.</p>
    <h5>In-flight Scope</h4>
	    <p>Rules with In-flight scope, only qualify for selection if the robot is in motion. 
	    If you are trying to maintain a straight line path, to perfect a striped pattern, then in-flight 
	    rules in conjuction with the Pure Pursuit algorithm, can be an effective way to keep the robot on-path. 
	     </p>
    <h5>Any Scope</h4>
	    <p>Rules with the scope set to Any will qualify whatever the motion state of the robot is. 
	    This may be suitable for detecting stage completion, or auxiliary rules.</p>
    <h5>Disabled Scope</h4>
	    <p>Rules can be disabled by setting their scope to disabled.</p>
    <h4>Auxillary Rules</h4>
	    <p>Auxiliary rules are needed to send <em>other</em> commands to the robot, which are not sweep commands. 
	       If no speed expressions are specified in the rule, then it is interpreted as an auxilliary rule. 
	       In this case the command specified in the Duration/Cmd field is sent to the robot. 
	       This is useful for manipulating the cutter in a dual cutter mower.

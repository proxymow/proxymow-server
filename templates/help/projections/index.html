<h2 id="projections">Projections</h2>
<p>
The <em>Projections Feature</em> provides a detailed view of selected projections from the buffer.<br/><br/>
A <em>projection</em> is simply the best isosceles triangle that encloses the contour. 
It is derived by reconstructing the vertices from the convex hull of the contour, 
which will have suffered erosion during processing.<br/><br/>
The buffer will only collect a handful of samples if the robot is static, 
but will add more samples once an excursion is in progress.
</p>
<p>The feature comprises:
<ul>
    <li>A header toolbar</li>
    <li>The Display Image</li>
    <li>The Analysis Image</li>
    <li>A Summary of the projection's attributes and scores</li>
    <li>A diagram of the projection</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>The Header Toolbar</h3>
<p>
    The header toolbar provides a freeze button and links to call up the first or latest projection, 
    and step backwards and forwards through the buffer. If you choose <u>latest</u>, 
    then the page will dynamically refresh with the latest projection processed.<br/><br/>
    Projection diagrams are expensive to compute, and the resource drain has a detrimental impact on frame rate. 
    Use the freeze button to pause page refreshes when they are not required, or close the tab. In any case auto-freeze 
    will kick in after a pre-defined interval.   
</p>
<h3>Display Image</h3>
<p>
    The display image shows the contour region as seen by the camera.
</p>
<h3>Analysis Image</h3>
<p>
    The analysis image shows the contour region as processed by the vision system. 
    This will include filtering and edge detection.
</p>
<h3>Projection Attributes</h3>
<p>
    The projection attributes are the salient properties of the projection which have been 
    chosen as measures that can be scored e.g. span, isoscelicity, etc.
</p>
<h3>Projection Diagram</h3>
<p>
    The projection diagram is a plot of the source contour, with its projected vertices.

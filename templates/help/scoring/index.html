<h2 id="scoring">Scoring Measures Feature</h2>
	<p>
	    The <em>Scoring Measures</em> feature allows the user to change the way projections are scored.<br/><br/>
	    The goal is to reward the target shape representing the mower, and penalise noise.<br/><br/>
	    The user can't configure new measures, but can change the setpoints, upper and lower ranges and maximum points scored. 
	    The default values should be suitable for most use cases.
	</p>
    <p>The feature comprises:
		<ul>
		    <li>A projection sample to experiment with</li>
		    <li>The Scoring Measures Editor</li>
		    <li>The Scorecard</li>
		</ul>
	    <div>There are five properties of the projection that can be scored:
			<ul>
			    <li>Span</li>
			    <li>Area</li>
			    <li>Isoscelicity</li>
			    <li>Solidity</li>
			    <li>Fitness</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Span</h3>
			   <p>The span is the derived distance from the base of the isosceles triangle to its tip.</p>
			<h3>Area</h3>
			   <p>The area is the area of the isosceles triangle.<br/><br/>
			     Both Span and Area are <em>scaled</em> measures. Rather than entering a fixed setpoint, 
			     the user provides a scale factor which is multiplied by the expected vlaue taken from the the mower configuration.</p>
			<h3>Isoscelicity</h3>
			   <p>This is a ratio derived from the relative side lengths of the isosceles triangle.</p>
			<h3>Solidity</h3>
			   <p>This is a ratio derived from the relative areas of the isosceles triangle and contour convex hull.</p>
			<h3>Fitness</h3>
				<p>Fitness is a measure of how well the derived projection fits the original contour.</p>
        </div>
		<p>
			Unlike Span and Area, Isoscelicity, Solidity and Fitness are setpoint measures. 
			This means the setpoints configured should work with targets of any size.
		</p>
    <p>There are four values for each scoring measure:
	    <ul>
	        <li>Setpoint</li>
	        <li>Lower Range</li>
	        <li>Upper Range</li>
	        <li>Maximum Score</li>
	    </ul>
	</p>
    <p>
        The maximumum score is an arbritrary number of points for the measure. 
        Measures can be <em>weighted</em> by allocating different maximum scores. 
        The maximum score is awarded if the projection property matches the setpoint. 
        The score reduces to zero as the projection property approaches the threshold in either direction, 
        i.e. the lower range below the setpoint, or the upper range above the setpoint. 
        It is important to note that any property with a value beyond the upper or lower thresholds 
        scores zero, and makes the total for that projection zero. Hence it will not be considered a viable target. 
        The final confidence value for the projection is expressed as a percentage, 
        calculated as:
        <div><pre>100 * sum of the scores / sum of maximum scores</pre></div> 
    </p>
    <p>
        When changing scoring measures the best way to validate the change is to hover over the relevant widget 
        in the scorecard and check that the calculation meets your requirements, before commiting the change by clicking the Save button.

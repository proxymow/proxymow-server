<h2 id="settings">Settings Feature</h2>
<p>The <em>Settings Feature</em> provides a number of forms to enable the configuration to be managed.</p>
<p>The feature comprises:
<ul>
    <li>A Menu pane - hosts an expanding tree menu</li>
    <li>A Form pane - holds the form to enable items to be edited</li>
</ul>
<p>
Not every element in the configuration can be edited here, and whilst some can, 
there are often better ways to accomplish the task.<br/><br/>
For example, Fence points and Calibration points cannot be changed outside of 
the Calibration and Fence features, due to their graphical context.<br/><br/>
Camera device settings can be changed, but it may be better to adjust them in 
the Vision feature where the effect is immediately apparent.  
</p>
<div>These are the main items that can be managed:
<ul>
    <li>Profiles</li>
    <li>Mowers</li>
    <li>Navigation Strategies</li>
    <li>Pairings</li>
</ul>
<h3>Profiles</h3>
<p>A profile is a convenient grouping of configuration items: Lawn, Calibration, Device, 
Connection and Hotspot. 
You may only require one profile per Proxymow server, but you can have more. 
You may need additional profiles for different cameras, or different fence definitions. 
The values in the Lawn, Calibration and Device groups are probably better managed in the Fence Editor, 
Calibration and Vision features respectively. The Connection is for an external logging database and is entirely optional. 
Hotspot allows the default hotspot to be specified, the one used by the Enrol command.</p>
<h4>Adding a new Profile</h4>

<p>
The device channel can be set to one of the following options:
<ul>
    <li>Virtual Camera</li>
    <li>Remote Pi</li>
    <li>Pi Camera</li>
    <li>Linux USB</li>
    <li>Windows USB</li>
</ul>
<p>The options may be limited to just those applicable to the host operating system.</p>
<h5>Virtual Camera</h5>
<p>This channel is always available, and is the default if no other cameras are available.</p>
<h5>Remote Pi</h5>
<p>Remote Pi fetches camera images from a remote pi camera, but does everything else locally. 
The aim is to share the resource load. If you select this option you need to enter the endpoint url of the remote pi.</p>
<h5>Pi Camera</h5>
<p>This option is only available on raspberry pi computers. It is the recommended option due to the superior performance of the pi camera.</p>
<h5>Linux USB</h5>
<p>Raspberry Pi can support USB cameras in addition to native cameras. 
Proxymow Server allows for multiple cameras to be connected which can be associated with different profiles. 
It is worth noting that USB cameras can't match the pi camera for performance, but may be easier to install. 
This is due to their small round cables as opposed to the ribbon connector on the pi camera.</p>
<h5>Windows USB</h5>
<p>This is a good camera option for testing and sytem familiarisation, but is unlikely 
to meet the demanding requirements for successful navigation, without significant lag. 
This stems from the underlying video frame capture mechanism.</p>
</p>
<h3>Mowers</h3>
<p>Mower settings are divided into four groups: Identity, Dimensions, Motion and Battery. 
<h4>Identity</h4>
<p>
The IP Address and Port need to be entered to identify the robot mower on the network. 
Virtual mowers are hosted by the Proxymow Server, so their ip address is 127.0.0.1 i.e. localhost. 
The type can be selected: virtual, hybrid or physical. 
</p>
<h4>Dimensions</h4>
<p>
The Target Width and Height refers to the base and the span of the idealised isosceles triangle 
enclosing the target shape. The Target Radius refers to the radius of the circle, centred on the vertices, 
that defines the truncation points. It is only used by Virtual mowers. The Target Offset is necessary for robots where the target is not 
centred on the turning point, i.e. the centre of the Axle Track. This is normally 50%. 
The diameters of up to two cutters can be configured. Mowing Patterns will be supplied with the mean diameter. 
The Body Width and Body Length are not used by the vision system, only the Target dimensions, however they are 
used for Virtual mowers to provide background contrast to the target.
</p>
<h4>Motion</h4>
<p>
The Axle Track is the distance between the wheels. 
From the values for Wheel Diameter and Motor Speed, the system calculates an idealised Linear Velocity in m/s. 
This is available to Navigation Strategies, along with the Set Speeds, 
so they can calculate the duration for sweep commands to achieve movement towards the destination.
</p>
<h4>Sensors</h4>
<p>
Sensors are the analogue channels coming from the robot.
As there can be a variable number of sensor channels, depending on device type, 
sensors are represented by two comma-separated lists: Names and Scale Factors.
Analogue values are standardised into the range 0..1023 irrespective of device type, 
so the displayed value is the scale factor multiplied by the value.
The first channel is assumed to be the main Battery Voltage and is the channel represented by the battery icon, 0..100%. 
</p>
</p>
<h3>Navigation Strategies</h3>
<p>Strategy desciption, Terms and Rules can be managed here, but the best way to make changes 
is within the context of the Navigation feature.</p>
<h3>Pairings</h3>
<p>Pairings are combinations of Profile and Mower. Mowers may be used on different lawns, and hence under different profiles. 
The user can add a Pairing that sets the Mowing Pattern and Navigation Strategy for any Mower/Profile combination, 
including wildcards.</p>
</p>
</div>
<div>In general, most configuration items can be viewed, edited, created, duplicated and deleted. 
Viewing and Editing is accomplished by clicking the relevant item in the menu, to open the form. 
Changes can be saved using the Save button, or the Cancel button can be used to dismiss the form. 
Create new items by clicking the 'Add ...' hyperlink at the bottom of the list of current items. 
Items can be duplicated by clicking the Duplicate Icon <img src="/icons/copy.svg" /> and deleted 
by clicking the Delete icon <img src="/icons/bin.svg" />.

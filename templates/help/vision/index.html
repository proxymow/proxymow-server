<h2 id="vision" class="jump-tgt">Vision</h2>
<p>The vision feature is used to configure the camera to get the best image of the lawn.<br/>
Different settings can be tried, before commiting. Once committed, the configuration will be updated 
and these settings will be used in all operations.  
</p>
<p>The feature comprises:
<ul>
    <li>A header toolbar</li>
    <li>The <em>Camera View</em> - displays the live image from the camera using current settings</li>
    <li>The <em>Settings Pane</em> - a toolpane with tools to adjust the settings</li>
    <li>The <em>Info Pane</em> - an information pane with various details about the camera/image displayed</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>The Header Toolbar</h3>
<p>This toolbar hosts a Profile dropdown, enabling the profile to be changed.</p>
<h3>Camera View</h3>
<p>The camera view displays the live image from the camera, updated every 5 seconds.</p>
<h3>Camera Settings</h3>
<p>
	<p>The camera settings include action buttons and various widgets to change the image.</p>
	<h4>Action Buttons</h4>
	<ul>
	   <li>Save</li>
       <li>Freeze</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Save</h4>
    <p>Save the settings so they are used by the system to detect the mower.</p>
    <h4>Freeze</h4>
    <p>Freeze the image refresh so the camera information can be analysed.</p>
    <h3>Property Settings</h3>
	<p>The available property settings will vary depending on the type of camera. 
	For numerical settings coarse adjustments can be made using sliders, and fine adjustments with the up/down arrows. 
	If you make changes to the settings to see the effect on the image, and need to reset to the current settings, you can refresh the page.
	Note that this may require a hard refresh in some browsers.<br/><br/>
	The parameters that can be adjusted may include the following:
	<ul>
        <li>Annotation</li>
        <li>Display Colour</li>
        <li>Horizontal Flip</li>
        <li>Vertical Flip</li>
	    <li>Automatic White Balance (AWB) Mode</li>
	    <li>Blue Gain</li>
        <li>Red Gain</li>
        <li>Resolution</li>
        <li>Undistort Strength</li>
        <li>Undistort Zoom</li>
	</ul>
    <h4>Annotation</h4>
    <p>Annotates the image with the current time. This is useful for checking camera operation.</p>
    <h4>Display Colour</h4>
    <p>Only grayscale images are used for detection, but the images displayed in features can be colour.<br/>
    Colour images can help when setting up the vision system, but do use more resources.</p>
	<h4>Horizontal Flip</h4>
	<p>Flips the image horizontally.</p>
	<h4>Vertical Flip</h4>
	<p>Flips the image vertically.</p>
    <h4>AWB Mode</h4>
    <p>The automatic white balance mode can be specified if the camera supports it. The 'Auto' setting will be best in most applications.
    If the AWB mode is set to 'Off', then the individual Blue and Red gains can be specified. This may be useful in low light situations.</p>
    <h4>Blue Gain/Red Gain</h4>
    <p>The Blue and Red Gain settings are only available when the AWB mode is set to 'Off'.</p>
    <h4>Resolution</h4>
    <p>The resolution is a critical setting. 
    At higher resolutions the mower target can be resolved more reliably, but the resources needed to process the image are higher. 
    Not all modes will work on every hardware configuration, and some modes may crop the field of view. These are marked with an asterisk in the list.
    </p>
    <h4>Undistort Strength</h4>
    <p>A Wide Angle Lens may be needed to get all of the lawn in the image.
    Invariably this will introduce distortion (and a rectangular lawn will look like a barrel!).
    The effects of distortion can be reduced by increasing the Undistort Strength setting.
    Unlike the other Vision property settings the Undistort Strength does not change the camera view image <em>in this feature</em>, 
    but overlays the outline of the lawn as a dashed rectangle which can be aligned with the image. 
    </p>
    <h4>Undistort Zoom</h4>
    <p>Undistort Zoom zooms the image to compensate for any changes in scale introduced by increased strength. 
    Fine tuning the distortion settings may be easier with Display Colour turned on. This provides a white outline 
    on a colour background, as opposed to a black outline on a greyscale background.</p>
